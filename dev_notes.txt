6/27/22 - Let user specify in config (and cmd line) their preference for downloading release builds, betas, and alphas
  -- IDEA : build_preference = "rba"
    r -- release
    b -- beta
    a -- alpha

  -- "rba" is their preference, so "rba" says to prefer a release build but 
    if there isnt one available then a beta is okay etc

  -- The user can also omit any one of these characters to opt out of that build 
    entirely: "rb" would not consider an alpha build, "b" would only look for betas etc

  -- The default if no build_preference was specified would be "rb" 
    (maybe just "r" but we can discuss that )

  -- REPRESENTATION: An enum with associated values that correspond to bit positions 

    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 -> 1 (0x1)
    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 -> 2 (0x2)
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 -> 4 (0x4)

    0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 -> An 8-bit number
              | | |
              a b r -> "rba"
    
    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 
                | |
                b r -> "rb"

    When parsing the configuration file we could iterate over the characters and 
    map the iterator to their corresponding enum values, then from there it would 
    be as easy as just using the "|" (OR) bitwise operator on all three:

      num = Enum1 | Enum2 | Enum3

    to get our number
